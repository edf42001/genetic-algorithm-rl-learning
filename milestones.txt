Milestones:

4/13/12:
Succseffuly implemented Deep Policy Network agent, reaches 92% win rate after only 200,000 iterations
Original lr of 0.01 sometimes leads to no learning, 0.001 works better, hidden layer size of 16 vs 8 seems to
learn slightly slower but not end up any better.

3/26/21: Cross Entropy Agent with decaying added std_dev noise, 16 x 8 x 5 dense neural net achieves 89% win rate,
5% lose rate against 2v2 CombatAgentEnemy. Tends to get stuck with second unit not attacking,
thus wasting potential damage.

3/11/21: Q Table agent achieves essential perfect win rate on 2v2 CombatAgentEnemy,
but starting positions are not randomized.
